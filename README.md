My Own Box
============

A small, fast and self hosted web based cloud server, with a minimal client included.

Think of it as a mini personnal github, super simple to use.

My Own Cloud lets you turn any folder into a simple file REST API, in one comand only. It automatically gets you a localtunnel adress so that you can access your cloud from anywhere without setting up any port forwarding or complex proxy.

A small client is integrated too, so that you can start using MOC straight away.

## Configuration
Add a conf.yml file at the root of your clouded folder to add some customization (see this conf.yml for available options)
