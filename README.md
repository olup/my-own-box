My Own Box
============

A small, fast and self hosted web based cloud server, with a minimal client included.

Think of it as a mini personnal dropbox, super simple to use.

My Own Cloud lets you turn any folder into a simple file REST API, in one command only. It automatically gets you a localtunnel adress so that you can access your cloud from anywhere without setting up any port forwarding or complex proxy.

A small client is integrated too, so that you can start using MOB straight away.

**Great for editing a static file blog, have a quick web folder to keep your files with you (but away from the NSA or Google), to edit your code on the go**

## Usage

npm install my-own-box
or download this rep and 
npm install

Then just navigate to the folder you wish to open to the world. Type in your console : my-own-cloud - 

## Configuration
Add a conf.yml file at the root of your clouded folder to add some customization (see this conf.yml for available options)
