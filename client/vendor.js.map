The viewmodel proxies all enumerable property of the original model with the following behavior:\n *  - as long as no new value has been assigned to the viewmodel property, the original property will be returned.\n *  - any future change in the model will be visible in the viewmodel as well unless the viewmodel property was dirty at the time of the attempted change.\n *  - once a new value has been assigned to a property of the viewmodel, that value will be returned during a read of that property in the future. However, the original model remain untouched until `submit()` is called.\n *\n * The viewmodel exposes the following additional methods, besides all the enumerable properties of the model:\n * - `submit()`: copies all the values of the viewmodel to the model and resets the state\n * - `reset()`: resets the state of the viewmodel, abandoning all local modifications\n * - `resetProperty(propName)`: resets the specified property of the viewmodel\n * - `isDirty`: observable property indicating if the viewModel contains any modifications\n * - `isPropertyDirty(propName)`: returns true if the specified property is dirty\n * - `model`: The original model object for which this viewModel was created\n *\n * You may use observable arrays, maps and objects with `createViewModel` but keep in mind to assign fresh instances of those to the viewmodel's properties, otherwise you would end up modifying the properties of the original model.\n * Note that if you read a non-dirty property, viewmodel only proxies the read to the model. You therefore need to assign a fresh instance not only the first time you make the assignment but also after calling `reset()` or `submit()`.\n *\n * @example\n * class Todo {\n *   \\@observable title = \"Test\"\n * }\n *\n * const model = new Todo()\n * const viewModel = createViewModel(model);\n *\n * autorun(() => console.log(viewModel.model.title, \",\", viewModel.title))\n * // prints \"Test, Test\"\n * model.title = \"Get coffee\"\n * // prints \"Get coffee, Get coffee\", viewModel just proxies to model\n * viewModel.title = \"Get tea\"\n * // prints \"Get coffee, Get tea\", viewModel's title is now dirty, and the local value will be printed\n * viewModel.submit()\n * // prints \"Get tea, Get tea\", changes submitted from the viewModel to the model, viewModel is proxying again\n * viewModel.title = \"Get cookie\"\n * // prints \"Get tea, Get cookie\" // viewModel has diverged again\n * viewModel.reset()\n * // prints \"Get tea, Get tea\", changes of the viewModel have been abandoned\n *\n * @param {T} model\n * @returns {(T & IViewModel<T>)}\n * ```\n */\nfunction createViewModel(model) {\n    return new ViewModel(model);\n}\nexports.createViewModel = createViewModel;\n\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/mobx-utils/lib/create-view-model.js\n// module id = 174\n// module chunks = 2","\"use strict\";\nvar mobx_1 = require(\"mobx\");\n/**\n * Like normal `when`, except that this `when` will automatically dispose if the condition isn't met within a certain amount of time.\n *\n * @example\n * test(\"expect store to load\", t => {\n *   const store = {\n *     items: [],\n *     loaded: false\n *   }\n *   fetchDataForStore((data) => {\n *     store.items = data;\n *     store.loaded = true;\n *   })\n *   whenWithTimeout(\n *     () => store.loaded\n *     () => t.end()\n *     2000,\n *     () => t.fail(\"store didn't load with 2 secs\")\n *   )\n * })\n *\n *\n * @export\n * @param {() => boolean} expr see when, the expression to await\n * @param {() => void} action see when, the action to execut when expr returns truthy\n * @param {number} [timeout=10000] maximum amount when spends waiting before giving up\n * @param {any} [onTimeout=() => {}] the ontimeout handler will be called if the condition wasn't met within the given time\n * @returns {IDisposer} disposer function that can be used to cancel the when prematurely.
